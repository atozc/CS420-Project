# CS420-Project
## Final Group Project for CS420 (Human-Computer Interaction) 

### **Title:** "A Space Journey" 
### **Abstract:** The team’s project, “A Space Journey”, is an educational 2.5D, side-scroller game that teaches the user facts about the solar system. The game will focus on having an interactive system and dynamic interface. The user will be able to freely travel through the solar system, in a rocket, and choose to land on different planets to learn facts. This will be through self-exploration and discovery. The game will be created with a younger audience in mind. Thus, it will be designed in a way that is engaging and easy to navigate. The game’s purpose is to use games as an alternative form of learning.
